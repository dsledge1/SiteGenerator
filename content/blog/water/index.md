# WATER!

I LIKE WATER
A LOT
A LOT LOT

BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

WHEN I GO TO THE PARK THAT HAS WATER, I GET IN THE WATER. IT TOUCHES MY BELLY AND I FEEL GOOD. LIGHT AND NIMBLE AND ENERGETIC AND GOOD. VERY GOOD. I RUN AND I SNIFF AND I JUMP IN THE WATER TO GET THE BALLS AND THEN I RUN AND DOGS CHASE ME.
