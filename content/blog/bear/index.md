## Mr. Bear - The Philosopher

I am the Bear. The Bear does a lot of thinking. He thinks about his people. He thinks about the squeaks. He thinks about the foods. He thinks about the bones. Mostly he thinks about play. The Bear likes play. If you play with the Bear, the Bear will love you. I am the Bear.

## Mr. Bear - The Lady's Man

Hi, I am Bear! I love the ladies. And by that, I mean I love the Stephanie. She feeds me. She gives me the toys. She loves when I squeak the toys so I squeak them lots. She loves when I give her hugs so I jump up to hug her lots. She definitely loves when I bring her toys nicely tenderized by me.

Oh yeah, I love dad too. He's ok. Not as good as mom. He does give me more treats though.
