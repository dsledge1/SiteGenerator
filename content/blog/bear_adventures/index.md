## Traveling Pup

The Bear goes on lots of adventures. Sometimes he goes on adventures on his own. He likes to go into the caves and fight monsters under the bed. Dad gets mad at me sometimes when I do that and take his socks, but I need the socks to keep me safe. Sometimes I go to the farm and hang out with a pack of other dogs. I like the farm. 

Sometimes I go on adventures with dad. He takes me to the store and gives me bones. And then we go to the park and I run, and then run more, and then I chase balls, and then run more. I keep my friend Milo in line when we go to the park and make sure he does not get any ideas. 

And sometimes we go HIKE. This my favorite. The humans let me off of the leash and I run up the path, and then I run back. and then I run up the path. And then I run back. I sniff. I pee. I nip milo's neck, and remind him that I am the bear. Then I run up the path again.
