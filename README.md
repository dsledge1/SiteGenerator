# SiteGen

This is an HTML site generator that uses markdown and pre-existing assets (i.e. images) to create complete HTML and push it to GitHub web pages. 

It currently supports *most* Markdown, but it certainly is not comprehensive. It was done as part of a boot.dev course, and I probably will not be implementing *all* markdown conversion.
