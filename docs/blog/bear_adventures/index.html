Sometimes he goes on adventures on his own. He likes to go into the caves and fight monsters under the bed. Dad gets mad at me sometimes when I do that and take his socks, but I need the socks to keep me safe. Sometimes I go to the farm and hang out with a pack of other dogs. I like the farm.</p><p>Sometimes I go on adventures with dad. He takes me to the store and gives me bones. And then we go to the park and I run, and then run more, and then I chase balls, and then run more. I keep my friend Milo in line when we go to the park and make sure he does not get any ideas.</p><p>And sometimes we go HIKE. This my favorite. The humans let me off of the leash and I run up the path, and then I run back. and then I run up the path. And then I run back. I sniff. I pee. I nip milo's neck, and remind him that I am the bear. Then I run up the path again.</p></div></article>
